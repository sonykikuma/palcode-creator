# Video Idea Generator

A web app that generates creative video content ideas using OpenAI's GPT-4.

## Project Description

Key objectives include:

Demonstrating React.js best practices
Implementing OTP-based login
Integrating AI APIs for video content generation
Enabling video publishing to social media
Implementing a content dashboard with filtering and analytics
